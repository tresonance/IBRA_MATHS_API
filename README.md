#### *************************************************

```
This API is composed of symbolic link 
towards MY_CHANELS_GENERIC and external geometry files
called ext-geometry.cpp and ext-geometry.hpp
```

```
INFO: 
You can do your additive staff inside those geometry files.
Please, do not change the geometry files name.

```
###### HOW TO RUN ?

#### =|=> MANIM DIRECTORY

```
1- build your manim scene : 
	
	source run.sh MANIM_DIR/mypython_script.py 

Fill free to check the new generated mp4 files, so runs :

open media/videos/path/to/mp4/files
```

```
2- Save your mp4 generated files: 

	source run.sh save

It will save the new generated scene, which lies inside shared directory called media 
(shared directory between host and docker, because here MANIM runs his script inside docker)
into DiskE and at the same time 
export the DiskE path (Exemple export VOLUME_VIDEOS_PHYSICS_PATH=/Volumes/DiskE/VIDEOS-Tle-Physics-mp4/dynamic/) into 
~/.bashrc file (because if we export simply, the variable will be lost after)

So, while running c++, it will load dynamically all mp4 files  from thate expoted variable.
No need to set manually , mp4 files names (as in old days)
```

```
3- C++ to run your scnene: 

	make re 
	or 
	make fclean ...

You have somes others options: so run :

source run.sh

to see all available option.
```

###### IMPORTANT NOTE
```
After you've run MANIM to generate your mp4 files, 
Simply save the files inside DiskE and update

if you run : 
source run.sh MANIM_PARAMETRIC/mypython_script.py, 
the script will save the mp4 file inside current DiskE directory (exemple: /Volumes/DiskE/VIDEOS-Tle-Maths-mp4/ext-geometry/parametric/plan//Equation_Cartesienne_Plan_4.mp4) and save permanently that file into a variable called VOLUME_VIDEOS_PATH (inside ~/.bashrc)
```

```
Now if you run your c++, it will first load each mp4 files dynamically from that directory .

by inserting the suitables courses mp4 files. 
```


### PATH
```
cd ~/COURSES/MY_CHANELS_GENERIC
```

##### CREATE DIFFERENTS SYMBOLIK LINK
```
1- To create ONLY_BOARD and SFE_SFML_LIBS_SYMLINK and libsfe_movie_bin.so symbolics link: 
    RUN: source run.sh symol
    >> This will create two links to ONLY_BOARD and with SFE_SFML_LIBS links called respectively ONLY_BOARD_SYMLINK , SFE_SFML_LIBS_SYMLINK and libsfe_movie_bin.so
```

```
    Nota: Be sure the library libsfe_movie_bin.so has already been created inside SFE_SFML_LIBS. If not 
    go to SFE_SFML_LIBS/basic_sfe and run: make -f Makefile_build_sfe_sfml_lib re
    >> Afer that rerun command: source run.sh symol
```

```
=> IMPORTANT: To use this API: 
please clone it and add your own 
ext-geometry.hpp and ext-geometry.cpp 
and add your mp4 files inside 
ONLY_BOARD_GENEIC/board-ext-geometry.cpp 
by updating variable 
const char *EXT_MP4_FILES_ARRAY[] = { ... }
```


### DOCUMENTATION AND USEFULS LINKS:

### HOW TO RUN THIS SOTWARE
````
-+- TEST MODE or REAL COURSE MODE (MACRO aka #define):

*=> To simply test a mp4 file : 
do not mount /Volume/DiskE, the script 
is so intelligent to detect it

*=> If you need real mode course, 
because the course mp4 file are inside /Volume/DiskE, simply mount the DiskE into your PC

------

*=> NUM_RENDER_WINDOWS: the macro which indicates the number of windows to open (default is 3), this macro is inside ONLY_BOARD/board-gpu.hpp 
````

```
>> To RUN:
```

```
1-First you need to create the three symbolic links:
>
ln -s /Users/ibrahimatraore/COURSES/ONLY_BOARD ONLY_BOARD_SYMLINK 
>>
ln -s /Users/ibrahimatraore/COURSES/SFE_SFML_LIBS SFE_SFML_LIBS_SYMLINK 
>>>
ln -s /Users/ibrahimatraore/COURSES/SFE_SFML_LIBS/basic_sfe/libsfe_movie_bin.so libsfe_movie_bin.so 

so RUN: source run.sh symol

Note: it will delete the symbolic links and recreate news.
``` 

```
2- Now Run
make clean && make fclean && make
```

```
>> Or To RUN:

make or make re
```
